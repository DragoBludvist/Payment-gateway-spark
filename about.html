     <h1> About us</h1>
<p class="one">We are here to create loads of opportunites to educate multiple children who are interested in education but are not able to get any.
<br>We would like you to help us help those children get educated.The is a possibility that one of those children might turn out to be great inventor or a scientist or one of the greatest minds in the world. 
This would be of great help to those children. This is a way by which they can succeed in life.
We might be able to not only help them but also help the whole society to grow.
This will lead to the development of our country.
